# **Relationship between Covid19 deaths and pre-existent comorbidities** #
## *Definition and evaluation of a Machine Learning model to better understand and predict Covid-19 fatal casualties in patients with previous chronic diseases.* ## 

***A Jupyter Notebook by Cristiano Esposito Â©2021***

**DISCLAIMER: any results of the studies reported are provided without medical evidences and have the mere purpose of statistical analysis and academic study.**

<p>This is a personal project to evaluate Machine Learning capabilities applied to a real-world scenario like the global pandemic caused by Covid-19 virus.
<p>In the notebook we are going to extract and analyze the nCoV2019 dataset (<a href='https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019/tree/master/latest_data'>here</a> is the link to the repository) to find correlation between the outcome of hospitalized patient and previous crhonic disease reported at the time of hospitalization. A model will be defined and tested to predict further probability of a death when some clinic informations are provided about certain patients.<br>
Data will be wrangled and then used to fit some classification algorithm (Logistic Regression) and the model will be then evalueted to check its accurancy over already known values.
<p>This project is currently a work-in-progress so further impovements will be provided and I'm also open to suggestions and collaborations.
